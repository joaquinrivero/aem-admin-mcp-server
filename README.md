## Quick Start

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
Use our [Universal Setup Tool](setup.html) to get your AEM API key and test the connection.

> **üí° Tip**: The setup tool includes authentication testing to verify your API key works before configuration.

### Step 2: Install for Your AI Assistant

**For Claude Code:**
```bash
npm install -g aem-admin-mcp-server
claude mcp add aem-admin --env AEM_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY --env AEM_BASE_URL=https://admin.hlx.page -- aem-admin-mcp-server
```

**For Cursor AI:**
1. Open the [Universal Setup Tool](setup.html)
2. Enter your AEM API Key
3. Click "üì± Add to Cursor (One-Click)" to automatically configure Cursor
4. Cursor will open and prompt you to add the MCP server

### Step 3: Start Using It!
Just ask your AI assistant to help with AEM tasks:
- "Publish the drafts/rivero/how-to page for adobecom/milo" ‚úÖ **Tested Working**
- "Create a preview for drafts/rivero/how-to on adobecom/milo" ‚úÖ **Tested Working**
- "Invalidate cache for drafts/rivero/how-to on adobecom/milo" ‚úÖ **Tested Working**
- "Generate a sitemap for adobecom/milo" ‚úÖ **Tested Working**
- "Create a backup snapshot named 'my-backup' for adobecom/milo" ‚úÖ **Tested Working**

## How It Works

This tool connects your AI assistant to AEM Live through a simple bridge. When you ask your AI to "publish a page," it automatically:

1. **Understands** your request in natural language
2. **Translates** it to the correct AEM API calls
3. **Executes** the action on your AEM Live instance
4. **Reports** back the results in plain English

## Common Tasks

### Publishing Content
Ask your AI: *"Publish the /en/products page for adobecom/milo"*

**What happens:**
- Your AI connects to AEM Live
- Publishes the specified page
- Refreshes the cache automatically
- Confirms the page is live

### Creating Previews
Ask your AI: *"Create a preview for /en/products on adobecom/milo"*

**What happens:**
- Generates a preview URL
- Shows you exactly how the page will look
- Perfect for testing before going live

### Managing Cache
Ask your AI: *"Refresh the cache for /en/products on adobecom/milo"*

**What happens:**
- Clears the cache for that specific page
- Ensures visitors see the latest changes
- Alternative: Just publish the page (cache refreshes automatically)

### Generating Sitemaps
Ask your AI: *"Generate a sitemap for adobecom/milo"*

**What happens:**
- Creates a complete sitemap of your site
- Helps search engines find all your pages
- Improves SEO automatically

### Creating Backups
Ask your AI: *"Create a backup snapshot named 'pre-release-backup' for adobecom/milo"*

**What happens:**
- Saves a snapshot of your current content
- Creates a restore point before major changes
- Includes optional description and specific paths

## What You Need

- **AEM Live Access**: Your organization must have AEM Live with Admin API enabled
- **API Key**: Get this from your AEM administrator or use our [setup tool](setup.html)
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Code or Cursor AI (both supported)

## Troubleshooting

### "API Key Invalid" or "Unauthorized" Error
- **‚úÖ Solution**: Use the [setup tool](setup.html) to test your API key first
- **‚úÖ Verified**: API key must use `Authorization: token YOUR_KEY` header format
- **‚úÖ Tip**: Ensure your API key has `admin` or appropriate roles

### "Page Not Found" or "Bad Request" Error
- **‚úÖ Verified**: Use correct format: `org: "adobecom", site: "milo", path: "drafts/page"`
- **‚úÖ Important**: Don't include leading slash in path (use `"drafts/page"` not `"/drafts/page"`)
- **‚úÖ Tested**: Organization and site names must match your AEM Live setup

### Cache and Performance
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Publishing content automatically refreshes cache
- **‚úÖ Working**: Direct cache invalidation tool now functional
- **‚úÖ Tested**: Both methods work for cache management

### Build Issues
- **‚úÖ Required**: Run `npm install && npm run build` before using
- **‚úÖ Environment**: Create `.env` file with your `AEM_API_KEY`
- **‚úÖ Dependencies**: Node.js 18+ required

## Tips for Better Results

### Be Specific
‚úÖ **Good**: "Publish the /en/products page for adobecom/milo"

‚ùå **Vague**: "Publish something"

### Include Context
‚úÖ **Good**: "Create a preview for /en/products on adobecom/milo main branch"

‚ùå **Missing**: "Create preview"

### Use Natural Language
‚úÖ **Good**: "Generate a sitemap for adobecom/milo"

‚ùå **Technical**: "Execute generate_sitemap with org=adobecom, site=milo"

## Advanced Configuration

If you need to customize the connection settings, you can modify these environment variables:

| Setting | What It Does | Default |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `AEM_BASE_URL` | AEM Live server address | `https://admin.hlx.page` |
| `AEM_API_KEY` | Your authentication key | Required |
| `AEM_TIMEOUT` | How long to wait for responses | 30 seconds |
